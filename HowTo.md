# How to for Renault Scenic ETECH 100% electric

This is a list of non-obvious stuff one needs to remember to not have to search
inside the manual all the time.

## When driving

*How do I set the speed when driving?*

If you have turned off the most advanced functions for assistance, you can use
the Speed Sign Button on the left side of your steering wheel to set the cruise
control to the current speed limit. Then you can up it a bit to avoid driving 3%
too slow :smile:

## When parked

*How do I park the window wipers in upright position?*

Power on, but engine off. Then push the indicator stalk upwards to times.

## Charging issues

*How do I pre-condition (pre-heat) the traction battery before charging?*

You have to navigate **VIA** a charger. If you didn't plan the route, you will
need to add a stop after the charger you are navigating to. It can be close by.
Renault assumes that you will have plenty of time to charge at your destination,
so no pre-conditioning will be started unless it is a via-point.
